2. Visual stimuli include images adapted from Downing et al. (2006), Konkle and Oliva (2012) and from open online image databases, and are to be used only for non-profit academic research. Make sure to clear any copyright issues with above-mentioned authors before publishing or presenting any results, data or samples based on these images.

3. When publishing or presenting work making use of any of the current resources please cite Brandman, Avancini, Leticevscaia and Peelen, 2019.


*** CONTENTS:

1. Analysis_code folder includes the .m file with detailed code and annotation for data analysis.

2. Stimuli folders includes all stimuli used in Brandman et al., 2019, as follows:
- stimuli_localizer: intact objects;
- stimuli_pics: degraded objects and gray rectangles (main experiment);
- stimuli_sounds: sounds wav files (main experiment);
- stimuli_words: spoken words wav files (main experiment);
- stimuli_noise: noise (scrambled sounds) wav files (main experiment);
- stimuli_indices:
(a) StimulusSubset_index: excel file with stimulus numbering, condition index and assignment to stimulus subsets (subject groups);
(b) ClearSounds_index: excel file with behavioral recognition accuracy and inclusion/exclusion assignment for "clear sounds" condition.
